# Streams API Examples

This repository contains various examples demonstrating the use of the Java Streams API. Each file illustrates different aspects of stream operations, including basic usage, aggregation, sorting, and parallel processing.

## Files and Descriptions

- **`AggregationExample.java`**: Demonstrates how to perform aggregation operations using Java Streams. Learn how to compute summaries, averages, and other statistics on data sets.

- **`BasicStreamExample.java`**: Provides foundational examples of using Java Streams, including basic operations like mapping and filtering.

- **`CollectToSetExample.java`**: Shows how to collect stream elements into a `Set`, highlighting how to handle unique elements and remove duplicates.

- **`FlatMapExample.java`**: Illustrates the use of the `flatMap` operation to flatten nested collections into a single stream of elements.

- **`GroupingExample.java`**: Demonstrates how to group elements by a certain property and perform aggregate operations on the grouped data.

- **`ParallelStreamExample.java`**: Provides examples of parallel streams for concurrent processing of data, showcasing how to leverage multi-core processors for performance improvement.

- **`SortingExample.java`**: Covers how to sort stream elements based on different criteria, including custom sorting logic and ordering.
