# Core Java Examples

Welcome to the Core Java Examples repository! This repository contains a variety of Java programming examples organized into different categories. Each category focuses on specific core Java concepts to help you understand and apply these fundamental programming skills.

## Directory Overview

- **[Collections](src/collections)**: Explore examples demonstrating various Java Collections Framework classes and interfaces. Learn about `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and other collection types.

- **[Generics](src/generics)**: Discover how to use Java Generics to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on typed parameters, enhancing code reusability and type safety.

- **[OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)](src/oops)**: Delve into core object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism through practical Java examples.

- **[Streams API](src/streams)**: Learn about the Java Streams API and its capabilities for processing sequences of elements. Examples cover stream operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.
